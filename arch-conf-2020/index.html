# Introduction
1. Team (dev team in more details)
2. Personal preentation and responsibility zone
3. List of services (both open and closed) that are/will be changed


---

# Current Development

* technological newcomers: gitlab, keycloak, ansible, terraform, borg (?)
* dropped technologies and approaches: manual bash/python script execution

---

# Gitlab

- central code repository, issue tracker
- why? powerful cicd, most of the integrations are present - here reasons behind gitlab 
- how? which functionality of gitlab has/can improve things 
- what is done? specific things running and set up already
- example of a workflow available influencnig specific service (for example testing with VMs before image release)

---

# KeyCloak

- SSO enabler
- why? security ways are mysterious and hard, but required
- how? flow definition, single source of functionality, multifunctional
- what? an example of the flow auth (maybe a short demo?)
- services affected

---

# FastAPI

if i'm not mistaken you decided to write own service but not sure instead of what or as an addition to what? wiki?

---

# Automations: Ansible

- why? desparate need of non-manual execution (chron, security, reproducibility reasons)
- how? are there atrenatives? what does it allow which previous approach did not?
- what? which parts of the platform are affected?   
- real example?

---

# Automations: Terraform

- why? why and where was it needed?
- how? wat have you gained? downsides?
- what? examples of usage for parts of the platform
- concrete example? (not sure it makes sense)

---

# What is left?

* services that are not refactored 
* what is planned for them
* Example?

---

# Future plans

* roadmap from your kanban board if you have one
* more power?
* black spots - what you will not touch in the near future and why

---
# Any volounteers?

* Who and how can help
* Open issues
* Other ways of contributing
